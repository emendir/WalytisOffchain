# Walytis Offchain Storage

P2P encrypted and authenticated communications, based on WalytisIdentities.
## Features

- fully peer-to-peer: no servers of any kind involved
- encrypt and send messages to all peers controlling a specified Walytis Identity
- decrypt and authenticate received messages, validate authorship by a Walytis Identity
- offchain storage: encrypted messages are not stored as Walytis blocks or IPFS content for security
	- a full record of past message metadata is always kept (guaranteed by the Walytis blockchain), message content can be deleted and forgotten if all peers decide to do so.
- identity management features inherited from Walytis Identities:
	- multi-controller support: a Walytis Identity can be managed by any number of controllers
	- identity nesting: Walytis Identities can be controlled by other Walytis Identities
	- ephemeral cryptography: regular key renewal, algorithm-agnostic, room for future algorithms

## Documentation

The thorough documentation for this project and the technologies it's based on live in a dedicated repository:

- [WalytisOffchain](https://github.com/emendir/WalytisTechnologies/blob/master/WalytisOffchain/1-IntroToWalytisOffchain.md): learn how WalytisOffchain works
- [Walytis Technologies](https://github.com/emendir/WalytisTechnologies): learn about the suite of tools which WalytisOffchain is part of, built to enable developers to easily develop peer-to-peer distributed applications.

## Project Status **EXPERIMENTAL**

This library is very early in its development.

The API of this library IS LIKELY TO CHANGE in the near future!

## [RoadMap](https://github.com/emendir/WalytisTechnologies/blob/master/RoadMap.md)

See the [Walytis Technologies RoadMap](https://github.com/emendir/WalytisTechnologies/blob/master/RoadMap.md) for the current plans for WalytisOffchain in the context of the larger [Walytis Technologies Project](https://github.com/emendir/WalytisTechnologies).
